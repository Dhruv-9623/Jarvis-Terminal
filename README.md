# 🔹 JarvisTerminal – Voice-Controlled Assistant

JarvisTerminal is a lightweight, voice-activated terminal assistant developed in Java. Designed specifically for restricted cloud-based environments like Replit, it allows users to interact with their system using voice commands for a smoother and hands-free experience.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Recognition** – Accepts and processes speech input to trigger terminal commands.
- 🗂️ **File Navigation** – Allows users to navigate and list directories using voice.
- 🌦️ **Weather Updates** – Provides real-time weather information via voice prompts.
- 💻 **System Commands** – Supports basic command execution such as open apps, search, and more.
- 🧠 **Modular Command Structure** – Clean separation of concerns and easy to extend.
- 🧵 **Multithreading** – Handles command recognition and response concurrently for real-time feedback.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java  
- **Environment**: Replit (restricted cloud setup)  
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses external speech APIs (e.g., Sphinx4 / Google Speech API if supported)  
- **Build Tool**: Maven (`pom.xml` included)
